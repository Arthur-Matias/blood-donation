Registration screen and login page focused on blood donation campaigns, developed for the first day of #DailyUI.

All art was developed using Figma and Adobe Suit. As the website's objective was to encourage people to donate blood, an impactful and captivating visual identity was chosen. The font used in this case was INTER, and to bring more seriousness, the color palette was based on grayscale.
